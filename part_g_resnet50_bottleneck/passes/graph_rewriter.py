    # WARNING: This is a simplified approach for demo: it will replace nodes by
    # post-processing the GraphModule and injecting call_function nodes that call
    # Python wrapper which runs the fused kernel. For production you should
    # construct a proper replacement GraphModule.

    # We'll implement a very small pass: run the model normally but after convs that
    # are followed by add->relu, call fused op in-place. For demo purposes, we'll
    # *not* mutate the FX graph; instead return a wrapper module that runs original
    # model forward, and applies fused operations at specific points is more involved.

    # For simplicity, we return the original model: the benchmark harness uses
    # module-level replacement via replacing Bottleneck.conv1 directly.
